    "Cardiovascular diseases affect a person's heart or blood vessels. These types of diseases are the leading cause of death across the world which explains why diagnosis at an early stage is important so that patients can get imediate treatment. Heart diseases are a specific group of cardiovascular diseases that refer to conditions specifically affecting the behaviour or structure of the heart. Multiple underlying health conditions and lifestyle choices can increase the likelihood of heart diseases, such as diabetes, obesity, high cholesterol, and high blood pressure. Some possible symptoms of heart disease are heart attacks, heart failure, chest pain, and strokes.\n",

Important factors that this dataset include are the patients' age, cholesterol level, and resting blood pressure level.\n",
